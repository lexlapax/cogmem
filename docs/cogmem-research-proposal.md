## CogMem: A Research Position and Proposal for a Cognitively-Inspired Memory Architecture for Large Language Models

**Author:** AI Research Analyst (Conceptual)

**Date:** October 26, 2023 (Revised)

### Abstract

Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit remarkable capabilities but often lack robust, persistent, and contextually rich memory systems analogous to human cognition. This limitation hinders their ability to maintain long-term coherence, personalize interactions, adapt to evolving contexts, and perform complex reasoning tasks requiring integration of past experiences. Current approaches often rely on extending context windows or simple vector database retrieval, failing to capture the dynamic, structured, and emotionally salient nature of biological memory. This paper synthesizes insights from recent work on LLM memory architectures, cognitive science inspirations, and agentic systems (e.g., MemGPT, Cognitive Architectures, MemoryBank, SR-CIS) and addresses critiques regarding the depth of current LLM cognition ("Cognitive Mirage"). We propose **CogMem**, a novel memory architecture designed to endow LLMs with a more sophisticated and functionally effective memory system. CogMem integrates distinct working and long-term memory stores (including episodic, semantic graph, and procedural/scripted memory), introduces a **Memory Valence** system for scoring emotional and goal-oriented significance, enables fine-grained **Memory Partitioning** (user, entity, shared), incorporates **Scripting Engine** for dynamic rule-based memory processing and evolution, models **Memory Lifespan** using valence-modulated entropy decay, implements a **Causal Memory Layer** for structured reasoning, aggregates **Valence Over Time**, provides a **Memory Trace Visualizer UI** for transparency, and supports **Composable Agent Personas** via scriptable memory filters. We argue that CogMem represents a significant step towards more capable, personalized, and adaptive LLM-based agents, particularly for complex, ongoing interaction scenarios such as assisting a small business owner.

### 1. Introduction

Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive fluency and knowledge recall, driving advancements in various AI applications (Brown et al., 2020). However, their core transformer architecture primarily relies on a fixed-size context window, creating inherent limitations in handling long-term dependencies, maintaining consistent personas, learning from past interactions effectively, and reasoning over extended periods (Packer et al., 2023; Zhou et al., 2024). This lack of persistent, structured, and dynamic memory prevents LLMs from achieving deeper levels of understanding, personalization, and autonomous adaptation, often leading to repetitive interactions, loss of context, and an inability to build upon prior knowledge â€“ hallmarks of biological cognition. These limitations are particularly acute in applications requiring continuous, context-rich interaction, such as providing ongoing, personalized assistance to a small business owner who deals with evolving customer relationships, project statuses, and operational details over weeks and months.

Recent research has explored various avenues to augment LLMs with memory capabilities. Approaches range from treating LLMs like operating systems managing memory tiers (Packer et al., 2023), developing specific cognitive architectures incorporating memory modules (Wang et al., 2023a; Yao et al., 2023), enhancing LTM with external databases like MemoryBank (Wang et al., 2023b), surveying existing memory mechanisms (Zheng et al., 2024), and exploring dynamic, human-like recall and consolidation (Kim et al., 2024). Systems like SR-CIS focus on self-reflection and decoupling memory from reasoning (Zhou et al., 2024), while others explore applications in specific domains like manufacturing (Chen et al., 2024).

Despite this progress, existing systems often lack crucial cognitive features:
1.  **Nuanced Memory Salience:** Memories are often treated uniformly or based on simple recency/relevance, neglecting emotional or goal-related significance critical for prioritization (e.g., distinguishing a critical client complaint from a routine update).
2.  **Flexible Access Control:** Granular control over memory visibility and sharing across different users or contexts (e.g., separating personal preferences from shared project data) is often underdeveloped.
3.  **Dynamic Rule Application:** Memory processing logic is typically hardcoded, limiting adaptability to new situations or user-specific needs.
4.  **Explicit Causal Links:** The ability to reason about *why* something happened based on memory (e.g., understanding the root cause of a project delay) is often implicit at best.
5.  **Integrated Forgetting Mechanisms:** Realistic memory decay beyond simple eviction is rare, preventing the system from gracefully handling vast amounts of information over time.
6.  **Transparency and Controllability:** Understanding and influencing the agent's memory state is often opaque, hindering trust and effective collaboration.

Furthermore, it is crucial to acknowledge the "Cognitive Mirage" critique (Jiang et al., 2023), which cautions against overstating the cognitive fidelity of current LLM-based systems. Our goal with CogMem is not to replicate human consciousness but to engineer a *functionally effective* memory system inspired by cognitive principles to significantly enhance LLM capabilities in practical applications like the target small business assistant scenario.

**Our Proposal: CogMem**
We propose CogMem, a comprehensive memory architecture designed to address these limitations. CogMem integrates multiple memory components and novel mechanisms:

*   **Working Memory (WM):** A limited-capacity buffer for immediate context processing.
*   **Long-Term Memory (LTM):** Multi-component LTM including:
    *   *Episodic Memory:* Time-stamped events and interactions.
    *   *Semantic Graph Memory:* Nodes (concepts, entities) and edges (relationships) capturing structured knowledge.
    *   *Procedural Memory:* Storing executable Lua/Python scripts for behaviors and rules.
*   **Memory Valence Engine:** Assigns scores based on emotional tone, goal relevance, and arousal/intensity.
*   **Memory Partitioning:** Segregates memory based on user, entity (organization), and allows explicit sharing.
*   **Scripting Engine (Lua/Python):** Enables dynamic, rule-based memory retrieval, consolidation, and modification, allowing script evolution.
*   **Memory Lifespan Modeling:** Implements an entropy decay function modulated by valence (important memories persist longer).
*   **Causal Memory Layer:** Annotates memories with causal links ("because", "so that") for structured reasoning.
*   **Valence Aggregation:** Tracks the evolution of valence for concepts/events over time.
*   **Memory Trace Visualizer:** A UI dashboard for real-time inspection of memory states and processes.
*   **Composable Agent Personas:** Scriptable memory filters defining agent personality archetypes (e.g., optimistic, skeptical).

This paper outlines the conceptual framework of CogMem, grounds it in existing research, details its novel components (including implementation considerations), states our research position, proposes a phased research and evaluation plan focused on demonstrating value in specific use cases, and discusses potential risks and mitigation strategies.

### 2. Related Work

The quest to imbue AI with effective memory is not new, but the advent of LLMs has spurred significant innovation. Our work builds upon several key research threads:

**2.1 LLMs as Operating Systems / Agentic Frameworks:**
The idea of framing LLM interaction with external resources (like memory) through an operating system analogy has gained traction. **MemGPT** (Packer et al., 2023) explicitly proposes this, using virtual context management to handle information flow between the LLM's limited context window and external memory stores, akin to OS paging. This addresses the finite context limit but focuses primarily on efficient information retrieval rather than cognitive structuring. A recent survey further explores this OS analogy for LLM agents (Gou et al., 2024), highlighting the need for resource management, including memory. **CogMem adopts the core idea of managing information flow between the LLM and external memory but enriches the external memory with cognitive structures and dynamics beyond simple storage.**

**2.2 Cognitive Architectures for LLM Agents:**
Inspired by cognitive science, researchers are developing architectures that structure LLM agents with distinct cognitive modules. Wang et al. (2023a) provide a survey of such architectures, emphasizing components like perception, action, and memory. Chen et al. (2024) apply this concept to manufacturing decision-making, demonstrating the practical utility of structured cognitive approaches. **CogMem directly aligns with this philosophy by proposing a dedicated, multi-component memory module designed with cognitive principles in mind.**

**2.3 Explicit Long-Term Memory Mechanisms:**
Several works focus specifically on implementing LTM for LLMs. **MemoryBank** (Wang et al., 2023b) uses an external database with an encoder-retriever mechanism to store and recall past interactions, improving consistency in long conversations. Kim et al. (2024) focus on more human-like dynamic recall and consolidation, aiming to make agents feel more understanding ("My agent understands me better"). **SR-CIS** (Zhou et al., 2024) introduces a self-reflective system that decouples memory from the reasoning module, allowing for incremental learning and reflection on past experiences. Zheng et al. (2024) provide a comprehensive survey of memory mechanisms used in LLM agents, categorizing them by storage format (e.g., natural language, embeddings, structured data) and operational mechanisms (e.g., encoding, retrieval, management). **CogMem incorporates insights from these approaches by including distinct episodic and semantic LTM stores but adds novel layers like valence, causality, and scriptability for more dynamic and nuanced memory management.**

**2.4 Critiques and Foundational Context:**
It is vital to temper enthusiasm with critical evaluation. The "Cognitive Mirage" paper (Jiang et al., 2023) argues that current LLMs, even when augmented, primarily perform sophisticated pattern matching rather than demonstrating true cognitive understanding or reasoning. They caution against anthropomorphizing LLM capabilities based on fluent output alone. **CogMem acknowledges this critique. Our aim is not to claim AGI or consciousness but to build systems that *functionally mimic* aspects of cognitive memory to improve performance on complex, long-duration tasks requiring context, personalization, and adaptation, such as the small business assistant use case. The mechanisms proposed, like valence and causality, are engineered features inspired by cognition, not emergent properties.**

**2.5 Gaps Addressed by CogMem:**
Synthesizing this related work reveals several gaps that CogMem aims to fill:
*   Lack of integrated, multi-dimensional **valence scoring** influencing memory dynamics.
*   Limited mechanisms for **fine-grained partitioning and sharing** of memory contexts.
*   Predominantly static memory processing rules, lacking **dynamic scriptability and evolution**.
*   Absence of **explicit causal annotation** within memory traces for structured reasoning.
*   Simplistic or absent models of **memory decay/forgetting** beyond basic eviction.
*   Poor **transparency and control** over the agent's internal memory state.
*   Underdeveloped concepts of applying **personality archetypes** directly to memory operations.

CogMem directly targets these gaps by introducing novel components designed to address each point, aiming for a more robust and cognitively plausible (in function, not necessarily implementation) memory system.

### 3. The CogMem Architecture

CogMem is conceptualized as a modular system that interfaces with a core LLM, augmenting its capabilities with a sophisticated memory hierarchy and associated processing engines.

**3.1 Core Components:**

*   **LLM Core:** Any capable foundational LLM (e.g., GPT-4, Llama 3, Claude 3). CogMem acts as an external module accessed via API calls or function calling mechanisms.
*   **Memory Interface:** Manages the flow of information between the LLM core, WM, and LTM. It handles memory queries (e.g., "retrieve relevant memories for user X about project Y"), updates (e.g., "store this conversation summary"), and consolidation triggers (e.g., "consolidate important WM items to LTM"). Inspired by MemGPT's information flow management (Packer et al., 2023). This interface could expose functions like `retrieveMemory(query, filters)` and `storeMemory(item, metadata)`.
*   **Working Memory (WM):** A small, fast buffer holding currently salient information, analogous to human WM. This likely maps closely to the LLM's actual context window or a managed subset of it, potentially represented as a short list of recently accessed/generated memory IDs or summaries. Information here is highly accessible but transient unless consolidated to LTM.
*   **Long-Term Memory (LTM):** A persistent, multi-component store, potentially using a combination of databases:
    *   **Episodic Memory:** Stores sequential records of events, conversations, and experiences, timestamped and associated with context (user, time, session ID, source). *Implementation Detail:* Could use timestamped JSON objects or text chunks stored in a document database (e.g., MongoDB) or vector database (e.g., Pinecone, Chroma), indexed by embeddings for similarity search and by metadata (timestamps, user ID, valence score) for filtered retrieval.
    *   **Semantic Graph Memory:** A knowledge graph storing entities (people, companies, projects, concepts) as nodes and their relationships as edges (`[User]-<works_on>-[Project]`, `[Client A]-<expressed_concern_about>-[Feature B]`). *Implementation Detail:* Could use a dedicated graph database (e.g., Neo4j, ArangoDB) supporting Cypher or AQL queries for traversing relationships. Nodes can store aggregated valence, summaries, and links to relevant episodic memories.
    *   **Procedural Memory (Script Store):** Stores executable Lua/Python scripts defining rules, behaviors, or memory processing logic (see 3.2.3). *Implementation Detail:* Scripts stored as text in a simple key-value store or document database, associated with triggers (e.g., "on_memory_retrieval", "nightly_consolidation") or persona profiles.

**3.2 Novel Mechanisms (Our Original Contributions):**

*   **3.2.1 Memory Valence Engine:**
    *   **Concept:** Assigns a multi-dimensional score to memory items reflecting their significance.
    *   **Dimensions:** Emotion (positive/negative polarity initially, potentially categorical later), Goal Relevance (-1 to +1), Arousal/Intensity (0 to 1).
    *   **Scoring:** Derived from sentiment analysis, keyword matching (e.g., "urgent," "problem," "success"), explicit feedback, task outcomes, or LLM inference prompted to assess significance. *Initial Implementation:* Start with simple polarity (+1/-1/0) based on keywords and basic sentiment, adding goal relevance based on predefined task types.
    *   **Example Use Cases (Small Business):**
        *   Memory: "Client Acme Corp emailed: 'Contract renewal approved! Excellent work.'"
        *   Valence Score: `{ polarity: +0.9, goal_relevance: +0.8 (revenue goal), arousal: 0.7 }`
        *   Memory: "Supplier reported shipment delay for Project Phoenix components."
        *   Valence Score: `{ polarity: -0.7, goal_relevance: +0.9 (project timeline goal), arousal: 0.8 }`
        *   Memory: "User mentioned attending a local tech meetup."
        *   Valence Score: `{ polarity: +0.1, goal_relevance: +0.2 (networking?), arousal: 0.3 }`
    *   **Impact:** Influences retrieval priority (high absolute valence prioritized), consolidation strength, memory lifespan, and agent persona expression.

*   **3.2.2 Memory Partitioning:**
    *   **Concept:** Logically separates memory stores based on context.
    *   **Partitions:** User-Specific, Entity-Specific (e.g., the small business itself), Shared (e.g., between owner and specific employees), Global.
    *   **Management:** The Partition Manager applies metadata filters during storage and retrieval based on the current interaction context and permissions. Ensures client A's data isn't retrieved when discussing client B.

*   **3.2.3 Scripting Engine:**
    *   **Concept:** Allows defining dynamic rules for memory processing using Lua or Python.
    *   **Capabilities:** Custom retrieval logic, conditional consolidation, memory modification, rule evolution. *Initial Implementation:* Start with a library of predefined, validated Lua/Pythn scripts for common tasks (e.g., "retrieve_urgent_client_issues", "summarize_project_updates") triggered via specific function calls from the LLM or Memory Interface. Focus on robust sandboxing using libraries like `luvi` or custom environments.
    *   **Interaction:** LLM could generate parameters for a predefined script (e.g., `executeScript('find_related_tasks', {project_id: 'Phoenix', status: 'delayed'})`) which the Scripting engine executes against the memory stores.

*   **3.2.4 Memory Lifespan Modeling:**
    *   **Concept:** Models forgetting, prioritizing significant memories via valence-modulated decay.
    *   **Mechanism:** Entropy decay function reduces accessibility/persistence score over time.
    *   **Valence Modulation:** Decay rate inversely modulated by absolute valence score. `Accessibility(t) = InitialAccessibility * exp(-k * (1 - Weight * abs(ValencePolarity)) * t)`
    *   **Implementation:** Can be run as a periodic background process or updated lazily during retrieval (checking `t` since last access/update).

*   **3.2.5 Causal Memory Layer:**
    *   **Concept:** Augments memories with explicit causal links (`caused_by`, `leads_to`).
    *   **Annotation:** *Initial Implementation:* Focus on extracting explicit causal statements ("Project delayed *because* supplier missed deadline") or allowing user annotations. Later explore simple LLM inference prompted to identify potential cause-effect pairs within conversation summaries. Store links as relationships in the Semantic Graph or as metadata on Episodic entries.
    *   **Example:** `[Supplier Delay Event] --<leads_to>--> [Project Phoenix Delay]`
    *   **Use Case:** Enables structured reasoning for questions like "Why is Project Phoenix delayed?" by tracing back through `caused_by` links.

*   **3.2.6 Valence Aggregation Over Time:**
    *   **Concept:** Tracks evolving valence for entities/concepts in the Semantic Graph.
    *   **Mechanism:** Update node valence scores (e.g., for 'Client Acme Corp' or 'Project Phoenix') based on the valence of new related episodic memories, using weighted averaging favoring recency or intensity.

**3.3 User Interaction & Control (Our Original Contributions):**

*   **3.3.1 Memory Trace Visualizer UI:**
    *   **Concept:** Real-time dashboard for transparency.
    *   **Features:** WM View, LTM Matches, Valence Bars, Script Log, Agent Mood History, Graph Visualization. Essential for debugging and building trust, especially in business contexts.

*   **3.3.2 Composable Agent Personas:**
    *   **Concept:** Define agent personalities via scriptable memory filters and biases.
    *   **Implementation:** Select specific Lua/Python scripts or parameter sets (e.g., valence bias values, retrieval thresholds) based on a chosen persona ('proactive_assistant', 'cautious_planner').

### 5. Proposed Research Plan & Evaluation

Our research plan follows a phased approach, prioritizing core functionality and incremental integration, with a strong focus on demonstrating value in the **Small Business Owner Assistant** use case.

1.  **Phase 1: Core LTM and Prioritized Mechanisms:**
    *   **Focus:** Implement foundational LTM stores (Episodic - Vector/Doc DB; Semantic - Graph DB) and the Memory Interface.
    *   **Priority Track 1A (Valence Focus):** Implement simplified (binary polarity + goal relevance) Valence Engine. Integrate valence scores into metadata and develop basic valence-weighted retrieval logic.
    *   **Priority Track 1B (Scripting Focus - Parallel or Alternative):** Implement sandboxed Lua Engine with a small set of predefined scripts for common retrieval/filtering tasks relevant to the use case. Integrate basic Partition Management (User/Entity).
    *   **Initial Data Structures:** Episodic: JSON logs with `timestamp`, `user_id`, `entity_id`, `content_embedding`, `valence_score`, `share_scope`. Semantic: Graph nodes (`id`, `type`, `name`, `aggregated_valence`) and edges (`source`, `target`, `relation_type`, `timestamp`). Procedural: Key-value store mapping script names to Lua code.
    *   **Outcome:** A functional prototype capable of storing, partitioning, and retrieving memories with either initial valence weighting OR basic scriptable filtering.

2.  **Phase 2: Feature Integration and Refinement:**
    *   Integrate the outputs of Phase 1 tracks (e.g., add scripting capabilities to the valence-focused prototype or vice-versa).
    *   Implement Lifespan Modeling (Valence-modulated decay).
    *   Implement initial Causal Layer (explicit annotation extraction).
    *   Develop the Memory Trace Visualizer UI (basic functionality).
    *   Refine Valence Engine (explore multi-dimensional scoring) and Scripting Engine (more complex scripts, triggers).
    *   Implement Valence Aggregation on semantic nodes.
    *   Develop initial Composable Personas via script parameterization.
    *   **Outcome:** A more complete CogMem prototype integrating multiple novel mechanisms.

3.  **Phase 3: Evaluation (Focused on Small Business Assistant Use Case):**
    *   **Task-Based Evaluation:** Test CogMem-LLM vs. Baseline-LLM (e.g., RAG only) on simulated or real (with consent) small business scenarios requiring:
        *   *Client Relationship Management:* Recalling past interactions, issues, preferences, and sentiment shifts for specific clients over long periods.
        *   *Project Tracking & Troubleshooting:* Retrieving relevant updates, identifying dependencies, recalling past blockers, and reasoning about delays using causal links.
        *   *Personalized Task Management:* Remembering user priorities, recurring tasks, and context across sessions.
        *   *Adaptive Communication:* Adjusting tone and focus based on aggregated valence associated with clients or projects.
    *   **Memory Quality & Component Utility Metrics:**
        *   *Retrieval Relevance (Valence Impact):* Measure NDCG@k or Recall@k for retrieved memories relevant to specific business tasks (e.g., "Summarize urgent issues for Client X"). Compare performance with vs. without valence weighting in retrieval ranking. Correlate retrieval of high-valence memories with successful task completion or positive user feedback scores.
        *   *Causality Utility:* Create question sets based on simulated business events (e.g., "List the reasons mentioned for the Q3 marketing campaign success", "What caused the server outage last Tuesday?"). Measure F1 score or human rating of accuracy/completeness of answers generated using the Causal Layer vs. baseline.
        *   *Scripting Effectiveness:* Define tasks solvable primarily by scripted memory filtering/aggregation (e.g., "Generate a list of all clients with negative sentiment in the last month", "Summarize billable hours per project this week"). Measure task success rate and efficiency (e.g., reduction in LLM calls) using scripts vs. complex prompting of the baseline.
        *   *Longitudinal Coherence:* Measure consistency of responses and information recall across multiple simulated days/weeks of interaction using perplexity or specific probe questions.
    *   **User Studies (Simulated/Wizard-of-Oz or Beta):**
        *   Qualitative feedback from users role-playing as small business owners regarding the agent's perceived memory, understanding, proactiveness, and usefulness.
        *   Task success rates and efficiency metrics for users completing standard business tasks with CogMem vs. baseline.
    *   **Ablation Studies:** Systematically disable CogMem components (Valence, Scripting, Causality, Decay) to quantify their individual contribution to performance on the target use case tasks and metrics.

### 6. Discussion, Risks, and Future Work

**6.1 Risk Assessment and Mitigation Strategies:**

*   **Risk: High Complexity & Integration Difficulty:** Integrating numerous complex components (Valence, Scripting, Causal, etc.) is inherently risky and prone to bugs or unpredictable interactions.
    *   **Mitigation:** Adopt a strictly modular design with well-defined APIs between components. Implement thorough unit and integration testing. Follow the phased approach (Sec 5), prioritizing core features and ensuring stability before adding complexity. Simplify initial mechanisms (Sec 3).
*   **Risk: Feasibility of Novel Components:** Valence scoring, causal inference, and dynamic scripting are challenging AI problems in themselves.
    *   **Mitigation:** Start with simplified versions (binary valence, explicit causality, predefined scripts). Leverage existing libraries/models where possible (e.g., sentiment analysis). Focus validation on specific, high-value scenarios within the target use case. Set realistic expectations about initial accuracy.
*   **Risk: Scripting Engine Security & Stability:** Allowing executable code introduces potential security vulnerabilities and runtime errors that could corrupt memory or halt the system.
    *   **Mitigation:** Implement robust sandboxing for the Scripting engine (restricting file system access, network calls, resource limits). Start with predefined, vetted scripts. Introduce script evolution cautiously with strong validation and testing protocols. Provide clear documentation and limits for user-defined scripts if enabled later.
*   **Risk: Scalability and Performance:** Processing valence, graph queries, scripts, and decay for large memory stores could create unacceptable latency.
    *   **Mitigation:** Optimize database queries (indexing). Implement asynchronous processing for non-critical tasks (e.g., decay calculation, some consolidation). Explore caching strategies. Design data structures for efficient querying. Profile performance continuously and optimize bottlenecks. Define acceptable latency targets for the use case.
*   **Risk: Parameter Tuning & Calibration:** Numerous parameters (valence weights, decay rates, etc.) require careful tuning.
    *   **Mitigation:** Start with sensible defaults based on literature or heuristics. Use evaluation tasks to guide tuning. Explore automated hyperparameter optimization techniques on benchmark tasks. Provide transparency and control over key parameters via the UI or configuration files.
*   **Risk: Evaluation Scope & Metrics:** Evaluating the true impact of subtle cognitive features like valence or causality is difficult. The proposed evaluation is extensive.
    *   **Mitigation:** Focus evaluation tightly on the primary use case (Small Business Assistant) and specific, measurable tasks within it. Prioritize metrics directly reflecting improvements in task success, user satisfaction, and efficiency. Use ablation studies to isolate component contributions. Acknowledge qualitative aspects and use user studies to capture them.

**6.2 Limitations:**
*   **Scalability:** Even with mitigation, managing massive LTM stores remains a challenge.
*   **Valence Calibration:** Achieving universally accurate valence remains difficult.
*   **Script Complexity:** Overly complex scripts could become unmanageable.
*   **Computational Overhead:** Added processing layers increase cost and latency.
*   **Cognitive Fidelity:** Functional mimicry, not true cognition, is the goal.

**6.3 Future Work:**
*   **Cross-Modal Memory:** Handle images (receipts, product photos), audio (meeting snippets).
*   **Advanced Causal Inference:** Integrate formal causal discovery/inference.
*   **RL for Script Evolution:** Optimize Scripting Engine scripts via reinforcement learning.
*   **Distributed CogMem:** Secure sharing/syncing across users/agents.
*   **Deeper Persona Integration:** More nuanced persona effects on reasoning/expression.
*   **Hardware Acceleration:** Explore specialized hardware for graph/vector ops.

### 7. Conclusion

Standard LLMs suffer from fundamental limitations in memory persistence, structure, and dynamics, hindering their potential in complex, longitudinal applications like assisting small business owners. Inspired by cognitive science and building upon recent advancements, we propose CogMem, a novel memory system designed to provide more robust, nuanced, and functionally effective memory capabilities. By integrating working and multi-component long-term memory with innovative mechanisms like Memory Valence, Memory Partitioning, Scripting Engine, Causal Annotation, Lifespan Modeling, Valence Aggregation, Visualization, and Composable Personas, CogMem offers a path towards LLM agents that can learn, adapt, personalize, and reason more effectively over long timescales. Our phased research plan, focused on specific use cases and incorporating risk mitigation, aims to demonstrate the practical value of this approach. While acknowledging the distinction between functional mimicry and true cognition, we believe CogMem represents a significant research direction for enhancing the capabilities and practical utility of Large Language Models.
