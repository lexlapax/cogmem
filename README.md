[![Build Status](https://github.com/lexlapax/cogmem/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/lexlapax/cogmem/actions)

CogMem is a cognitively-inspired memory library for Go, providing persistent, structured, dynamic, and context-rich long-term memory (episodic, semantic, procedural) functionality for AI agent systems. This repository contains the Go module scaffold under `cogmem-go/`, currently in Phase 1 of implementation.

---

## Features

CogMem implements:

* Clean/Hexagonal Architecture (Domain, Application, Infrastructure)
* PostgreSQL persistence with the pgvector extension
* Partitioned Episodic Memory storage and retrieval (vector similarity & recency filters)
* Modular scripting via Lua engine
* Valence scoring and metadata support
* Test-Driven Development (TDD) and Docker-first workflow


---

## Current Status

See [Implementation Plan](implementation-plan.md) for the full roadmap and upcoming tasks.

## Getting Started

<!-- Instructions on how to get the project set up and running locally. -->

### Prerequisites

* Go 1.24+
* Docker & Docker Compose
* PostgreSQL 15+ (for production/testing) or use Docker Compose for local development

### Clone and Install

```bash
git clone https://github.com/lexlapax/cogmem.git
cd cogmem-go
go mod download
```

### Docker Compose (Local PostgreSQL)

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

*Note:* A `docker-compose.yml` providing PostgreSQL with pgvector support will be added as part of the infrastructure setup (Phase 1).

## Key Documentation

Understand the project goals, design, and plan:

## Configuration

CogMem uses Viper for configuration, loading in order:
1. `config.yaml` in the working directory
2. `.env` file
3. Environment variables

Example `config.yaml` placed alongside your application:
```yaml
database_url: postgres://postgres:password@localhost:5432/cogmem?sslmode=disable
embedding_dim: 1536
decay_base_rate: 0.01
decay_valence_weight: 0.5
decay_interval: 1h
# Additional settings (e.g., Lua sandbox) follow here
```
*   **Implementation Plan:** [./implementation-plan.md](./implementation-plan.md)
*   **Structure Philosophy:** [./project-structure.md](./project-structure.md)

## Documentation


## Testing

Run all unit and integration tests:
```bash
cd cogmem-go
go test ./...
```
Integration tests will spin up PostgreSQL with pgvector via Testcontainers.
## Other Considerations
